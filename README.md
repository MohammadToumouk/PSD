## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/psd-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd psd-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger hot module replacement, and you will be able to see the changes in real-time.

2. Build the production-ready assets:

   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will generate optimized and minified assets for production use. The output files will be placed in the `dist` directory.

- The `src` directory contains all the source code for your React application.
- Inside the `src` directory, the `components` folder is where you can place reusable UI components.
- The `pages` folder is where you define the individual pages of your application.
- The `App.js` file is the entry point for your React application.
- The `index.js` file is responsible for rendering the root component (`App`) and mounting it into the HTML template.
